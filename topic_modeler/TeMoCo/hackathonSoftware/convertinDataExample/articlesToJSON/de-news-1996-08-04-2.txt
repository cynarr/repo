<H1> Brawls in Bremen </H1> After a quiet night, Bremen was witness to more altercations today, with police temporarily arresting about 100 persons. A police spokesperson reported that members of the autonomous groups lit up garbage cans and attacked police officers. This situation is now under control, he added. During Friday night and Saturday morning, the Bremen part of Ostertor was witness to heavy fighting between several hundred punks and police forces. The punks chose Bremen after being prevented to congregate in Hannover, which had prevented a renewal of the so-called "Chaos days" by outlawing organized gatherings. Police in Hannover is on the watch, but no unrest was reported throughout the night.
