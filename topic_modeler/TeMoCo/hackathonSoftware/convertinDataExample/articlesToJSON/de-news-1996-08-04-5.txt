<H1> Priebke judges in focus of retrial debate </H1> Filing conflict-of-interest charges against the head judge of the Rome tribunal, both public prosecutors and joint plaintiffs want to obtain a new trial against the former SS officer Priebke. In Rome today, public prosecutor Scandura said this was the only way to open the trial again. If the Court of Cassation approves the charges, the verdict would be suspended. Judge Guistelli was quoted as saying before the trial that he expected Priebke to be acquitted. However, two charges of conflict-of-interest already failed during the proceedings. The military tribunal had found Priebke guilty of taking part in the execution of 335 Italian civilians in the Ardeatine caves, but ruled that the statute of limitations had expired.
