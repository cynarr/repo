The former fall convention is now called \"Tendencies.\" Through exhibition of numerous novelties, the suppliers hope to re-attract consumers. However, the number of German exhibitors has declined yet further compared to last year's number. 5000 suppliers from almost 90 countries are participating in the convention, which is organized around three main areas. One of them is \"Domus and Lumina,\" meaning house and light. It includes gift ideas that focus on dining and the kitchen. The exhibitions range from trash containers to cultured pearls, from super flat flash lights to inflatable chairs. They include Christmas decorations, as well as machines for paining Easter eggs. One of the most expensive gift ideas is a model of the Frankfurt convention tower, made of pure rock crystal and steel, selling for 60,000 Marks. Expensive splendor is a major general trend in gift ideas. A new addition to the Frankfurt convention this year is a Gourmet Shop, which exhibits foods which are especially suited as gifts.

The FDP economics expert, Graf Lambsdorff, today came out in favor of advancing the enactment of significant parts of the overhaul, currently planned for 1999. On Deutschlandfunk radio Lambsdorff explained that in view of the employment situation, a speedy reduction of the highest tax rates is necessary. Within the reform package, Lambsdorff considers an increase of the VAT [value added tax, sales tax] possible, in order to be able to cut income tax significantly. The head of the FDP parliamentary group, Mr. Solms, however, has deviated from the FDP's demand to enact the tax reform as early as 1998.

The workers' unions announced their disapproval of the plans. The union for public service and transportation and union for chemical industry noted they were especially opposed to taxation of overtime compensation for work during the night, as well as on Sundays and holidays. The chair of the union for public service and transportation, May, explained that with this measure the government was going to raise two additional billion Marks in tax revenue, but it would also place a financial burden on those who already were exposed to extraordinary pressures in their professional lives. He added that the proposed changes would also increase the financial burden on employers, as overtime pay would become not only taxable, but there would also be payments for welfare insurance. The union for chemical industries accused Finance Minister Waigel of having broken his promise in this context, because just a year ago, he had given his assurance that such plans were not to be taken under consideration. At an event in Munich, the chair of the union for chemical industries, Zwickel, noted that while those with lower incomes were to feel a slight relief if the new regulations took effect, the advantages for those with high incomes were disproportionally higher. Zwickel considered such a development unacceptable for a political basis of social equality. He added that in light of the high unemployment rate, the government's suggestions for the tax reform could only be interpreted as a poorly staged theatrical play. The chief executive officer of the Association of German Social Security Carriers (VDR), Franz Roland, writes in a newspaper article that his association fears that with the proposed tax reform there will also be a continually increasing financial burden on social security recipients.

So far, the only possible way of transfer was supposed to be the feeding with BSE contaminated animal feed. Since this theory can no longer be upheld, it is possible that animals which were not born on the island, but have British \"ancestors\" could develop the disease years later.

Finance Minister Waigel labelled the session \"purely for effect\" and said the SPD's exercise was costing taxpayers a six-figure sum. He accused the SPD of blocking necessary budget consolidation measures despite voting in favour of the Maastricht treaty. The party was responsible for the high budget deficits and the hostile climate experienced by investors. Waigel said he was nevertheless confident that the criteria for joining the European monetary union next year would be met. Opening the session, SPD parliamentary faction leader Scharping accused the Federal Government of misleading the electorate with its finance policy. He said it was high time for an aboutface in what was a disastrous application of policies that burdened the citizens. He spoke of \"the greatest tax swindle in German history\". SPD chairman Lafontaine criticised the government's fiscal policy as unsound. He also blamed the governing coalition for the steadily increasing unemployment rate in Germany. Speaking for the Alliance 90/Greens, faction spokesperson Fischer emphasised that there was currently no leeway for tax cuts. Merely more fairness in taxation was a possible option, but only if the interests of small lobby groups were not more important as the country's interest, as was the case with the FDP Liberal Democrats. Fischer accused Waigel of \"snapping at heels because of being non-plussed\" and attacked the FDP for being a party of \"old turncoats\". FDP chairman Gerhardt called the opposition \"defenders of old domains\" steadfastly opposed to any reform. He also spoke of the opposition's populism directed against the government and defended the FDP against the \"turncoat\" label. The party did have the ability to correct its course if necessary, He said. Speaking for the former communists PDS, faction leader Gysi called on Chancellor Kohl, who is on an official state visit in the Philippines, to ask for a no-confidence vote after his return in order to make possible an early election. Using the coalition parties' majority, parliament rejected a resolution supplementary to the 1996 budget and moved for by the SPD, which was designed to attest an unbalanced overall economic situation. The SPD argued that by rejecting the proposal, the budget had become unconstitutional, as new debt was higher than new investment by the state. According to the Basic Law constitution, this was only possible in cases where the overall economic balance was disturbed. Earlier, Scharping had reiterated the accusation that the budget was unconstitutional. He pointed out that the allowable limit of new debt prescribed by the Basic Law had already been passed by five billion deutschmarks in September. Waigel replied that fiscal experts agreed that the limit of allowable new loans taken out referred to the planning of the budget and not to its actual application. Immediately preceding the debate, Waigel had been called on to resign by SPD finance expert Matthaeus-Maier.

He said that it was interesting, but not all of the details had been made public yet. Schaeuble, the leader of the CDU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, said that there was no shortage of work in Germany, but rather the problem is that it is too expensive to employ people, so it is unlikely that new jobs would be created if hours were cut,as this might cause wage-costs to rise even more. Rexrodt, the federal minister of economics, also rejected the idea, and called instead for more flexible working patterns.

During the debate in a speacial sitting of the Bundestag to address Germany's financial situation, Waigel said the new numbers would not cause a change in the Government's basic concept. He also said that the SPD shared the blame for the situation, thanks to its blockading of consolidation efforts by the Coalition. It was announced yesterday that federal, state, and municipal governments are now expected to take in DM 18 billion less in taxes than expected. The finance minister's plans - to cover part of the deficit through a higher assessment of monetary reserves and the sale of Telekom shares - have caused some commotion. <P> The Opposition is charging that the Government has plunged Germany into an unprecedented state of financial chaos and that it now furthermore wants to breach the country's gold reserves - practically the oath of disclosure of failed policies. The Coalition counter-charges that Germany would be better off today if not for the SPD's irresponsible blockade in the Bundesrat, and it maintains that there is no alternative to cutting government expenditures and carrying out the reforms which it has planned. Finance Minister Waigel also defended the plan to assess Germany's gold reserve at a higher value: \"The reassessment will be approached with due caution. The financial solidity of the Central Bank will be manintained. Preparedness for monetary risks, as well as the volume of the gold reserves will remain untouched. Not a single ounce will be sold, and not a single ounce will flow into the budget. <P> Waigel said that the controversial move to reassess the Central Bank's gold reserves was not a finance trick, but rather was absolutely justifiable given the debts inherited from former East Germany. <P> The SPD financial expert, Matheus-Meier, accused Waigel of tax fraud and irresponsible debt-accumulation, adding that the intention to move on the Central Bank's gold was the height of insolence: \"Imagine that an SPD finance minister had come up with the idea of touching the gold reserves. This Government would jump out of the 29th floor in disgust and revulsion.\" <P> Matheus-Meier also said that Waigel had plunged Germany into an unprecedented financial chaos: \"Someone who shamelessly defends and glosses over this kind of financial chaos, based on the motto 'eyes shut, and ever onward' - that person is holding a very bad hand. Not a word about a supplementary budget, not a word about concrete numbers, not a word about what they really want to do. This is really making a mockery of this parliament.\" <P> The SPD also accused the Government of presenting tidied-up figures for years now, while Waigel went around the country, distributing untenable promises. They say that Waigel is the minister responsbile for tax lies and mountains of debt, and that wanting to tap into Central Bank gold and Telekom shares is the pinnacle of unreliable finance policy. <P> The Opposition also claims that it is clear, since yesterday at the latest, that the Coalition's tax reforms have now failed once and for all, as there is no money to finance them. The Coaltion counters that the tax estimate only brings more immediacy to the need for their planned reforms, because lower tax rates would ultimately result in greater employment and revenues. <P> FDP chairman Wofgang Gerhardt accused the SPD of absenting itself from reality, while its leader, Oskar Lafontaine was an ideological prisoner to Social Democrat conceptions.

The global economy's external requisites for economic growth, he continued, were absolutely favorable for the G7 countries, and Germany was included in this prognosis. The international monetary fund was counting on quotas above 2%, Mr. Weigel continued. To be sure, in the face of the most recent unemployment figures, the Federal Republic would definitely have to execute the necessary structural reforms. In this regard, some of he European neighboring countries and the USA were already ahead of Germany, he continued. For this reason, the strength of the dollar in the international monetary exchange market would have to be considered a natural development in the face of the stable economic situation of the USA and compensation for the former undervaluation of the dollar. In connection with this, the president of the Federal Bank, Hans Tiedtmeier, added that the strength of the dollar did not signify a weakness of the German mark.

While a complete version of the report by the health insurance companies is not expected until the end of the year, experts consider the results from Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse, and Saxony-Anhalt, which have already been evaluated, to be representative. These results are now center of the discussion concerning savings measures in the health sector. The Schleswig-Holstein health insurance companies estimate that on average every tenth hospital in-patient could be treated as an out-patient; in urology the average is close to every fifth patient. Especially on Sundays there are many unnecessary hospitalizations. The Kiel speaker for the Association of Employee's Health Insurance Companies (VdAK) concluded that the emergency care units of the hospitals are not at all well organized. Another reason for the high number in hospitalizations are general practitioners, who prefer to refer their patients to hospitals, rather than to specialists. As a concrete example, the VdAK lists patients suffering from mild diabetes caused by old age. For this specific medical problem, the VdAK considers hospital stays of several days to be unnecessary in most cases. The data from Hesse implies as one of its most frequent examples the removal of screws and metal plates used in the reconstruction of broken bones. Also for chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer, in-patient treatment is usually not necessary, explained the Frankfurt speaker for the VdAK.

Physicians who prescribe such services when unwarranted will be held liable. The health insurers urged the government to change legislation accordingly, in order to render the objectives feasible.

One thing is clear after the education summit last year: The chancellor is not willing to rely on the promises made by the employers. Too big is the danger that someone has to run after these promises year by year. Subjects of discussion were two suggestions for a solution: Decrease of the salary for trainees or an apprenticeship fee for businesses that do not provide training. Lower salaries and a shorter vocational training are the key to more vacancies according to a survey performed by the chamber of commerce in Rhineland-Palatine, fees are the suggestion made by the DGB (German federation of unions). Both ideas have been rejected by the employers as well as by the federal minister for education, Ruettgers. Remaining is the chambers of commerce's suggestion to allow apprentice wages of up to 30 percent below the wage agreement, a suggestion that will result in vehement discussions with the unions. According to a 1991 Federal Constitutional Court decision, an ppropriate salary cannot be more than 20 percent lower than the wage agreement.", "de-news-1997-03-09-3.txt": "<H1> SPD have set conditions for continued tax-reform talks </H1> The Social Democrats (SPD) have set certain conditions to the German government for continuing the tax-reform talks.

However, Hirsch said, Schmidtbauer was now increasingly assigned tasks that conflicted with his duty as the supervisor of the secret service. Hirsch added that no matter how competently the chancellor set the guidelines, the minister in charge should be the one solely responsible for foreign policy, and should report solely to the parliament.

Despite various verbal attacks, the parties represented in the Bundestag showed a willingness to compromise on the question of tax-reform. <P> Even before the meeting of the CSU (in the Nibelungen-Halle in Passau) started, Protzner, the General Secretary of the CSU, made it clear that his party expects the CDU and the FDP, its partners in the ruling coalition, to formulate a clear position on the basic points surrounding the planned pension reform within the next two months; in his opinion, there is no point in putting off the decision any further. Finance Minister Waigel, the leader of the CSU, made an offer to the SPD to bring the starting point of the tax reform forward, to January 1998. He showed that he had changed his position on the basic points here by announcing that workers should benefit from the first stage of tax reductions, planned for next year, as well as business and industry. Waigel also said that the lowest rate of tax should be reduced in stages from its present level (25.9 per cent) to around 20 per cent, and that the highest rate should be reduced to under 50 per cent, as long as the complimentary financial considerations are also given a certain priority. <P> The SPD held its traditional Political Ash Wednesday meeting in Vilshofen. Renate Schmidt, the leader of the Bavarian SPD, had already spoken out in favour of talks with the CDU/CSU about a possible compromise on the question of the tax reform in the run up to today's meeting. Lafontaine, the political leader of the SPD, reinforced the fact that he was prepared to work with the other parties to work out the tax reform quickly; at the same time, he demanded the dissolution of Kohl's government, as did the Greens at their meeting in Biberach. Both Lafontaine and Schmidt accused Kohl and his government of total failure in its economic and financial policies. Lafontaine indicated, however, that he was ready to compromise with the government on the tax reform, but he also emphasised that the reform must be introduced in 1998 and must lead to a reduction in the tax burden for those with the lowest incomes. <P> At the FDP's meeting in Baierbach, Gerhardt, the leader of the FDP, accused the SPD of impeding tax reductions through a policy of obstruction. Westerwelle, the General Secretary of the FDP, said that Employment Minister Bluem's suggestions regarding the pension reform could not be carried out politically, and were not particularly forward-looking. Stadler, the leader of the Bavarian FDP, warned about the possible consequences of the disagreement between Waigel, the leader of the CSU, and Stoiber, the Premier of Bavaria. He said that it was not the case that the CSU had a dual-leadership, but rather that it was like a party with two faces, which was endangering the coalition in Bonn. <P> The Bavarian Greens demanded the dissolution of parliament and new elections in Germany at the start of their political Ash Wednesday meeting in Vilshofen, with the justification that the Federal Government was unable to act decisively and the economy was performing badly. Scheel, a member of parliament for the Greens, said that the Federal Government had been living on its capital for years and that it was no longer prepared to bring in any real reform; furthermore, its taxation policies were dividing German society.

The prosecution demanded that the arrest warrants for the former GDR head of state and party, Mr. Krenz, as well as for Mr. Dolus, Mr. Kleiber, and Mr. Schabowski be executed. The prosecution argues that the risk of escape prevails, since all four of the accused have to expect long prison sentences. The Regional Court had previously issued arrest warrants for the former members of the politburo, but suspended their execution. However, Krenz, Dolus, Kleiber, and Schabowski have to surrender their passports. In the eyes of the court, this would contain the risk of escape. After the arrest warrants were announced, Egon Krenz repeated his opinion that he would not recognize any decision by a federal court. His lawyer said that the arrest warrants manifest that the court folded under public pressure. The fact that the arrest warrants were suspended means for the accused that they will remain free, but are subject to certain conditions.

He explained in a newspaper interview that the creation of new jobs should be the most important thing for everyone. Kohl's words were: \"I think that it's not too much to ask of those with work that they lower their demands or even entirely do without a real pay increase, so that the chances of finding work improve for those who are now unemployed.\" This would not even mean any real sacrifice for most people, Kohl continued, but it would only require them to do without any increase in their living standards. According to Kohl, the Federal Government still believed in the target that had been set in agreement with the unions to reduce unemployment by a half by the year 2000, but this would be very difficult to achieve. The Chancellor expects the common European currency to give a real push to the job market. At the same time, Kohl defended the government's strict policy of insisting that savings be made. He said that it was necessary to consolidate the budget so that the vicious circle of ever increasing debt and interest payments could be broken. Kohl's suggestions were resoundingly rejected by the opposition and the unions. Schulte, the leader of the DGB (German Federation of Trade Unions), said that workers had already had to accept reductions in real wages, in order to make it possible to create new jobs. The SPD said that the suggestion was a cynical one. Kohl's ideas met with agreement from the Council of German Chambers of Commerce. Its president, Stihl, said that a decrease in wage costs was a precondition for the creation of new jobs and the protection of current employment, especially in industry, and there must therefore be several years of zero pay increases. Eppelmann, the leader of the Employees' Association of the CSU, said earlier today on the 'Deutschlandfunk' radio station that he regards Kohl's suggestion as sensible, and he said that, as far back as 1972, the \"Club of Rome\" warned industrial nations that they were living beyond their resources, but that the consequences of this pronouncement had never been realised.

Thus, we are planning on implementing a full-text archival search function on our website in the coming year. If an opportunity presents itself, we will also think about a new look for our website; rest assured, however, the information will always be our first priority. <P> We would like also to express our gratitude to the listserv team of the GMD in St. Augustin and the Department for Applied Information Processing at the University of Ulm for their usual excellent technical support. <P> Finally, hearty thanks must also go to all of the transcribers and translators, who, in a spirit of team-work and with astonishing selfdiscipline, contribute regularly - and for no pay - to the success of GermNews and De-News. At this point I would like to single out Marion Sonnenfeld and Rainer Schulze, adding my best wishes for a speedy recovery. <P> In the spring of 1997, a GermNews Foundation will be created, the goal of which will be to support our work. This foundation, as a non-profit society, will be able to answer readers asking where they can send donations. It will also be the place where potential sponsors can make contact with the project. Obviously, readers will have the possibility of supporting GermNews by taking out a membership in the foundation. <P> To all the readers and colleagues of GermNews and De-News, I wish you a pleasant holiday season, a merry Christmas, and then a happy New Year.", "de-news-1996-08-24-9.txt": "<H1> Companies Take Indifferent Stance Toward Corruption </H1> In the view of Frankfurt corruption expert Wolfgang Schaukensteiner, the German economical leaders are indifferent to the growing problems of corruption. Specifically, he called on industrial circles to abandon their indifference. He explained that the policy of \"hear nothing, see nothing\" was very prevalent in the leading layers of the industry, and he called the managers to finally address the problem. Schaukensteiner added that the companies themselves took losses because of the practice of corruption. The expert estimates that roughly 5 million Marks in bribes are spent in Germany each year. Most affected is the building sector. Schaukensteiner considers the governmental proposals to counteract corruption to be insufficient. They are especially missing laws concerning the siphoning off of profits, as the profits from illegal businesses are the Achilles' tendon of corrupt businesses.

The council of the insurance industry declared that taxation of life insurance would endanger private retirement planning. The federation of tax payers pointed out that pension taxation could only affect those who are in their 30s today, and therefore cannot be applied to the financing of the thoroughgoing tax reform. In the face of this criticism the tax reform commission came to their apparent last meeting. The table of politicians and experts advised, among other matters, on the new rates of income tax. The highest tax rate under 40%, the introductory rate under 20%, with this goal the coalition's tax reformers went into the decisive round of negotiations. There is to be a net savings of the citizens' tax burden by the reduction of the tax rates of nearly 30 billion marks. The second question to be resolved today was to be: will a linear-progressive tax rate remain in the future, or will a simple step system be introduced, as the liberals advocate. The FDP-faction chief stated in support of the stepwise system that it is more transparent, more understandable and offers more options to work with a less oppresive \"ground floor\" tax rate. He also observed that all major European nations have a step system. Finance minister Waigel said that both systems have advantages and disadvantages, and that it was not a matter of dogma, rather that experts needed to work together to resolve the issue. It is still as unclear as ever whether the value-added tax will have to be raised in order to pay for the tax reform. Waigel excluded the possibility of additional income for financing the pension reform coming from a higher VAT. Waigel accepts the proposition that the social security system must be reformed from the ground up, and made fiscally feasible.

As dictated by tradition, the opposition parties took the opportunity offered by the budget debate to engage in general criticism of the government's policies. During the \"general debate\", the opposition accused the government of having fraudulent and anti-social policies. Social Democrats leader Lafontaine pointed out to Chancellor Kohl that large parts of the population did not believe the government's iniatitives to further growth and employment would be successful. The government and its policies had failed; its course of action was marked by social inequity, Lafontaine continued. A government that wanted to abolish capital tax at the same time as putting off the promised child rebates ought to be elected out of office, he added. The government had to be held responsible for unemployment, a decreasing standard of living, public debt and welfare cuts, Lafontaine said. The austerity \"savings package\" he called \"false labelling\". SPD parliamentary faction leader Scharping called for a fairer distribution of burdens. The will to bring this about was undetectable in the government, and the advocates of the socially weaker did not have a voice, he added. Faction spokesperson of the Alliance 90/Greens Fischer said the government's policies were solely designed to keep it in power. It was not interested in reforms, but rather just wanted to satisfy its clients. If the Kohl government remained in power, savings packages were to be expected every six months, Fischer continued, before calling for an end to the timid course taken by the opposition parties. CDU/CSU \"Union\" parliamentary faction leader Schaeuble accused the opposition of painting a caricature of the situation in Germany in order to accelerate the fears of the populace. At the same time however the SPD was blocking important laws designed to maintain Germany's attractiveness for investors, he added. Germany had to answer the callenge posed by international competition by introducing the planned spending cuts. The Germans had never had it so good as in the 90ies, but decisions had to be made now in order to maintain prosperity, Schaeuble continued. Chancellor Kohl vehemently rejected the opposition's criticisms, saying it closed its eyes to a changing world. Instead it made people anxious through theories of pauperisation. Red flags and war cries did not help the unemployed, Kohl said. Rather, reforms designed to make Germany fit for the future were the order of the day. His government's ambitious goal was a halving of the unemployment rate by the year 2000, Kohl continued. He called on trade unions and employers to make their contribution to the necessary structural reform. He warned against a Red-Green coalition at the federal level, citing North Rhine-Westphalia as a disgusting example of shying away from reform and lack of perspective. The Chancellor also said he was convinced that the Bundestag was going to pass the savings package on Friday. After that had happened, there would again be talks with the SPD and unions. If the Bundesrat upper house is going to reject the package tomorrow as expected, the government will need an absolute majority in the Bundestag on Friday. The governing coalition parties of CDU/CSU and FDP have 341 seats, four more than necessary. The package includes cuts to paid sick-leave, a relaxation of dismissal laws for small business, and a rise in the retirement age. In an interview, Kohl said the package was necessary and was in no way a contravention of the requirement for social justice. Additional lightening of the tax payers' load was only achievable through spending cuts, he said. The biggest social injustice of them all however was the inability of jobseekers to find employment, Kohl added.", "de-news-1996-08-11-1.txt": "<H1> EU calls for ceasefire in Chechnya </H1> The European Union called on the warring factions to come to an immediate ceasefire and return to the negotiating table.

A bill from the Ministry of Justice provides for violent crimes, such as murder and assault, to be punished more harshly, and other crimes, such as property and pecuniary offenses, less so. The plan has already generated heated debate. SPD legal expert Daeubler-Gmelin applauds the ministry's plans to base the range of possible sentences on the constitution, the Grundgesetz, which, as she says, places the protection of life over that of property. She warns, however, that it is not enough to change the sentencing in only one or two areas. The Green Party has stated that if sentencing patterns are to be changed, then property offenses should be re-categorized as lesser crimes than they are presently deemed to be. This suggestion has met serious resistance in Bavaria. The Bavarian justice minister warns against easing the legal seriousness of crimes such as robbery or kidnapping: \"I do not think much of the idea of - on the one hand, justly increasing sentences for crimes that threaten or violate the dignity and autonomy of an individual - while at the same time being much more lenient on serious property and pecuniary offenses. When I consider that the minimum sentences for serious cases of robbery or stealing are to be lowered - that is a step in the wrong direction.\" Concerning violent crime, the minister said that his state had called in the Bundesrat four years ago for harsher sentencing. According to the Judges' Federation, the reforms being discussed largely took place long ago in practice; they said that judges made use of the scope in the prescribed ranges of sentences and thus could punish assault more harshly than property offenses.", "de-news-1997-02-03-2.txt": "<H1> SPD agrees in part with Waigel's tax plans </H1> In the effort to work towards a tax reform, the SPD moved closer to the coalition's position.

During the process, specifically those insurance companies which still held on to social principles were being penalized. In an interview, the chair of the AOK board of managers, Peter Kirch, said that if the third stage of the health reform was carried out as planned, the AOK would have nowhere to go. The AOK would suffer losses so high in several regions that the association as a whole might not survive. Thus, Seehofer was penalizing the one insurance company that followed the strictest social principles in health insurance, explained Kirch. He explained that the reasons for the strained financial situation were the unfavorable pool of members, as well as the weak financial basis. In his opinion, the only way the AOK could survive would be to change the risk equity payment in its favor. Instead, it is slated to receive 850 Million Marks annually, as part of the structural reform. Already, the AOK was forced to collect higher premiums than for example the insurance companies with restricted membership. If the premiums were raised any further, and if the patients were required to make higher co-payments, as slated in the reform, then members would start switching to other providers.

In 1977, Ms. Andrawes together with three accomplices had hijacked a Boeing aircraft with 87 passengers from Mallorca. During the hijacking, captain Juergen Schumann (sp?) was shot dead. After an erratic route, the aircraft was stormed in Somalia's capital Mogadishu by members of German elite anti-terror unit GSG 9. In the action three hijackers were shot dead. Souhaila Andrawes was the only hijacker to survive. After short imprisonment in Somalia she went underground. She was detected in Norway in 1994 and extradited to Germany in 1995. The Higher Regional Court sentenced the 43-year-old Palestinian to 12 years in prison for murder, attempted murder, abduction in conjunction with taking hostages, and encroachment of air traffic resulting in casualties. The Court took into account the crown-witness regulation. The sentence was in line with the prosecution's demand. Souhaila Andrawes, who had entered the session room with a smile but shivering all over her body, asked for a break shortly after the sentence had been pronounced.

As expected, the opposing positions of Government and Opposition on these central issues clashed sharply. While Minister of Economics Rexrodt views the economy as being back on a track of stability, representatives of the Opposition accused him of failing in the battle against unemployment. While Minister of Employment Bluem called on the Opposition to join efforts in the projected pension reform, this was briskly rejected by the former. In the debate about budget cuts, Bluem clearly spoke out against levying a general tax on pensions. Such taxation would only be possible, if the premiums for pension insurance were tax-free, the Minister explained. Since the premiums paid by today's pensioners had been taxed, their pension payments now should remain tax-free. Bluem conceded, however, that the proposals for a tax on pensions have come from his own party's ranks, too, but this is beyond his control. \"I'm trying to cut glades into this jungle of proposals.\" When Bluem's appeal to the Opposition to contribute in the pension reform was turned down, Ottmar Schreiner commented that Bluem had forfeited the goodwill of the Opposition by increasing the retirement age for women prematurely. Before tackling the welfare budget, the apportionment for the Ministry of Economics was fiercely debated. Rexrodt hinted that further cuts in coal mining subsidies are imminent, the latter taking up more than half of his budget. The Minister commented on economic growth in a cautiously optimistic way, saying that three-quarters of a percent are secured for this year, and that two to two-and-a-half percent could be attained next year. Nevertheless, Rexrodt warned: \"One has to repeat that this is still insufficient to widely improve the employment situation.\" Scrapped items were also characteristic of the budget of Education Minister Ruettgers, having to put up with a reduction of 4.5%.

The taxation of interest experienced a change in regulation in Germany in 1993 after the Federal Constitutional Court had ascertained that the tax was not being levied uniformly and was not sufficiently verifiable.

The leaders of the union IG Metall, and the industry's employers' association could not resolve the conflict over full sick pay over their three-day negotiations. Thus, the hoped-for \"total package\" - which was also to have regulated holiday pay, Christmas pay, part-time work for the elderly, as well as pay raises for 1997 - did not become reality. Union leader Zwickel said the main points of contention were sick pay as well as holiday and Christmas pay. Zwickel accused the employers of squandering the chance of an agreement for the second time this year. He continued that their inability to compromise would threaten the basic wage agreement, too. Zwickel said the employers were afraid of a compromise and were just pushing the conflict into the regions and individual companies. He also accused them of trying to break the basic wage agreement and not being interested in really solving the problems. The leader of the employers' association, Stumpfe, said that sick pay was now a matter for individual companies to decide, and that the negotiations would return to the regional level. Stumpfe criticized the union, saying it had rejected out-of-hand all suggestions for lowering the costs associated with sick pay. He also indicated that sick pay, as well as part-time work for the elderly, would not be addressed at all in the basic wage agreement in the future. Furthermore, he said, there would be no more high-level discussions in the foreseeable future. <P> With the failure of negotiations, industry unions have announced that they will proceed with tougher measures.

The state union leader for Baden-Wurttemberg, Zambelli, said the conflict will now be taken to the work site. He declared his readiness to try again to negotiate a national settlement on the issue of sick pay in the talks for the south-west region on Monday.

Finance Minister Theo Waigel called it a \"budget of responsibility\". According to the budget draft, Dm440bn are going to be spent. This is a decrease of Dm11bn compared to this year's budget. Waigel wants to limite the deficit to Dm56bn in oder to meet the Maastricht criterias for the European monetary union. To keep the deficit this low, almost all ministries have to cut spending. Most affected are the Federal Labour Office, subsidies for coal mines, and the budget for personnel. The most controversial point is that the budget does not contain any subsidies for the Federal Labour Office. The Federal Government hopes that unemployment will decrease considerably next year. Only recently the government had to increase this year's subsidies to over Dm11bn. Therefore, the Social-Democrats (SPD) estimate an up to Dm18bn higher deficit. The Liberals (FDP) still see some considerable budgetary risks, as well. Even Waigel admitted that it is necessary to make further cuts to neutralise possible additional spending at the Federal Labour Office. Therefore it is necessary to push through the cuts in the job creation scheme, which are, however, hard to swallow for the CDU deputies of East Germany. Waigel believes the cuts to be necessary to secure Germany's position as base for economic activity. SPD financial expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier criticized the budget draft to be non-serious and socially unfair. She says the government blocks budgetary rehabilitation because it does not tackle the problem of high unemployment. The SPD demanded an amendment to the budget.

The head of the SPD, Mr. Oskar Lafontaine, opposes raising the valueadded-tax in the course of the planned tax reform. Mr. Lafontaine stated during an interview, \"We want to lower the taxes which benefit social programs, but this does not imply that general consumption other than the use of energy is to be taxed at a higher rate.\" On Friday, Federal Chancellor Kohl had called the increase unavoidable. Only with such an increase, he had stated, could a balanced relationship between direct and indirect taxes be established. Deputy CDU-head, Mr. Christoph Bergner supported the Chancellor's view. Mr. Bergner called financing the tax reform without an increase in the value-added-tax an illusion. Bavaria's Minister of Finance, Mr. Erwin Huber, agrees. The CSU-politician stated that an additional burden on consumption made absolute economic sense. According to the intentions of the Social Democrats, the tax reform is to help those with low or middle incomes. The SPD calls for a decrease in the entire income tax rate system; only then would there be no objection against lowering the highest income tax rate, Mr Lafontaine stated.

The federal government insisted on putting through its ideas for reforming the German \"social state\". It defended itself against heavy attacks from the opposition. Each side said the other was incapable of doing any kind of a good job of shaping Germany's future. At the beginning of the session, the leader of the SPD's forces in the Bundestag, Scharping, attacked the Chancellor, saying that Kohl was responsible for Germany's present situation, with high unemployment and tax increases. Scharping accused Kohl of looking for a scapegoat for his failed economic policies and, in his desperation, blaming the country's employers. He continued that Kohl was trying to sneak out of his responsibility for jobs and social justice. Scharping also called for the government to work with his party in lowering secondary wage costs, and to turn away from social confrontation: \"The person who responds to global competition with confrontation has not understood the principles upon which Germany's economic strength is based\". The leader of the CDU/CSU group in the Bundestag, Schauble, rejected Scharping's criticisms, saying that the situation in the federal states with SPD governments showed that the Social Democrats themselves had no ideas for solving the present problems. He suggested that it was the wrong approach to today's problems to start a new debate on the distribution of wealth. He said the SPD was still just calling for more government and more bureaucracy, and could not offer even a single savings measure of its own. Schauble also said that in the Bundesrat the SPD was blockading the government's planned cuts to subsidies. The government member did admit, however, that secondary wage costs were too high and had to be lowered. Chancellor Kohl called on the SPD to work with the coalition to find solutions. At the same time, he reiterated criticism of the SPD's \"blockade policy\" in the Bundesrat. Kohl said that, as an example, reforming the pension system would require cooperation between the parties; partisan politics would have to take a back seat to the problems facing the country. He said that the fight against unemployment would continue to be a priority, and the government would stick to its goal of halving the number of unemployed (presently approximately 4 million) by the year 2000. The leader of the SPD party, Lafontaine, affirmed that the SPD was willing to cooperate in order to fight unemployment, for example, but said that the government's economic policies were wrong from the ground up, as they diminished people's purchasing power. Lafontaine repeated the Social Democrats' demands for changes to the tax system to make it more just. He accused the coalition of throwing money at the well-off by eliminating the wealth tax. Kerstin Muller, the leader of the parliamentary forces of the Green Party, accused the government of no longer having a social conscience. She said her party would continue to be committed to preventing the worst social injustices. Following the discussions, the governmental majority in the Bundestag approved the chancellor's budget, as well as the budgets of the ministries of foreign affairs and defence. Traditionally, the opposition uses the occasion of the chancellor's budget to call the government to general account.

Now Mr Bluem wants to enter the ring, to negotiate, though he does not want government arbitration. \"We have to make good use of any chance or occasion for an agreement that's acceptable to both sides. We have to get away from confrontation, these days we're beyond that. We just have to come to an agreement on this issue.\" <P> Employers and unions consider this renewed stalemate as a step back, and mainly middle-sized companies are worrying about survival, plus each day without a minimum-wage agreement also means job losses for German construction workers.

The changes are intended to end the regional monopolies in electric power. Cities and counties will then no longer be able to grant the right of way for power lines to one supplier exclusively. The market for natural gas is to be similarly opened. Government plans will let households and businesses pick which supplier will deliver their power in the future. According to Federal Economic Minister Rexrodt, the changes will lead to lower electricity and gas prices for everyone; based on the example of Great Britain, Rexrodt hopes for a medium-term drop in price of 20 to 30 percent. Rexrodt's law is hotly debated. The SPD and the Green Party, as well as cities and counties have already announced their opposition. The SPD and the Greens fear that prices would fall only for large-scale purchasers, while private homes would have to pay more. Municipalities fear the loss of income in the billions of marks if earnings from municipal power plants dried up. Since the law does not provide for any duty to funnel through electricity on large overland lines, the Greens complained that \"what Rexrodt is doing is like giving all the autobahns to Mercedes and not letting VWs drive on them any more\".

After the year 2000, the Post Office may close another 2,000 branches. Mr. Boetsch, the acting Postal Minister, protested that this means that the specifications that the nearest post office be located no more than 2 kilometers away will not be met. According to the German Postal Workers\u001a Union, the agreement puts more than 20,000 jobs on the block. Union leader van Harn criticized this as unacceptable and warned the parties responsible against a social powder keg.

According to the details which were revealed today, the Post Office Bank will pay the Post Office 1.1 billion marks next year for the use of their teller windows. The fee decreases in subsequent years. The Post Office had originally requested 1.4 billion marks. To make up for the difference, the Post Office will receive 25% of shares in the Post Office Bank. The FDP objects to this, because it would give the Post Office too much influence on the bank. Liberals are therefore calling for additional talks.

The stroppy band from Germany's heavy industry area around the river Ruhr will be able to continue rehearsing using their old trademark, though no-one was telling how much money was involved. The background: after reports about the suicide of one of the female singers and other reports on alleged sleaze involving the band, the Hamburg agency obtained an injunction banning the band from using the name Tic Tac Toe, claiming that scandals and resulting headlines were hurting the agency's reputation. In 1994 the agency had trademarked the name, but had agreed to let the all-girls band use it provided they paid them some tens of thousands of marks.

Delegates at a mini party convention have come to this decision, accepting the course suggested by Employment Minister Bluem with a large majority.

The former director of the Stasi terror defence department, Dahl (sp?), said at the opening of the trial against him at the Regional Court in Berlin that there was an understanding between the governments in Bonn and East Berlin at that time. Dahl did allow, however, that his testimony was based on a subjective assessment of statements made by his bosses. The West German government had also supposedly been informed of the terrorists' whereabouts by the American secret service. Dahl and three other former Stasi officers are facing trials for the admission of 10 members of the RAF into East Germany.

They want to make sure Israel will deploy neither police nor armed forces nor invest in the areas until a final treaty has been negotiated. Meanwhile Germany asked for a break: according to the news agency AFP, Germany was unable to agree to the clause that would have put a stop to all aid Israel might use for settlement policies.

Hardly a day goes by when 59-year-old Avram cannot be seen side-by-side with any star of the music business in the Munich popular press. Of his present surroundings, however, there are unlikely to be any pictures, for Mr. Avram has been in solitary confinement in the Munich-Stadelheim jail since last night, when the investigating judge executed the arrest warrant issued several days previously. The charges are tax fraud.

However, it is expected that the Bundestag will accept the document with a large majority. A group of politicians who largely belong to the CSU intend to formulate their own declaration.
