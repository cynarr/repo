<h2>Introduction</h2>
Reflection is defined by Dewey (1933) as cited by Bulman & Schutz (2008) as:

Opening up one's practice for others to examine, and consequently requires courage and open-mindedness as well as a willingness to take on board and act on criticism (p.2).

It's an essential skill that health professionals have to learn when working within a multidisciplinary team to help improve the overall standard of care. The Nursing and Midwifery Council of England (2016) as cited by Flaherty (2016, p.16) emphasise that all nurses and midwives as of April 2016 will need to prove they are able to practice safely and effectively.  Therefore there is a need for nurses especially to be constantly analysing and reanalysing their actions and communication through reflection as they are at the frontline in practice. 

Nurses are vital in advocating patients' feelings hence their interpersonal skills need to be persistently clear, concise and easily understood to avoid miscommunication and putting the patient at risk (McCabe & Timmins 2006). In order for this to occur, nurses need to perfect the skill of reflection by using a reflective framework to improve their competency (Takase et al. 2015). The framework I will be using is 'The Reflective Cycle' by Rolfe et al. (2010).

<h2>What happened? </h2>
The clinical skill I was told to perform was manual blood pressure. Upon receiving the skill I was slightly nervous. Manual blood pressure (BP) seems straightforward but if not conducted correctly it's very easy to get inaccurate results (Rafey 2009). I brought the equipment over to the patient then <b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[0]" data-img="N0.png" data-reflexsect="wh">introduced myself and explained the process.</b> <b class="contextText" style="color:blue;font-size:18;" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="P1" data-slots ="[0]" data-img="P0.png" data-reflexsect="wh"> The patient expressed no feelings of discomfort</b> and consented for me to do their blood pressure. I tried to narrate all my actions in order to keep the patient informed (Rafey 2009). I sanitized my hands in preparation for the procedure. The patient stretched out their arm and I placed a pillow under it for support (Dougherty 2015). I sanitized again as I touched the patient's environment (World Health Organisation 2006).  <b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[1]" data-img="N1.png" data-reflexsect="wh">I then measured the circumference of the upper arm with the cuff</b> folded at the bladder, making sure it was 80% the circumference of the upper arm, 40% the width and placed it 2-3 centimetres above the brachial artery crease (Dougherty & Lister 2015).  <b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[5]" data-img="N5.png" data-reflexsect="wh">I informed the patient I would need silence to do the procedure</b>, but insisted they notify me if they were uncomfortable at any point. I placed two fingers on the brachial artery and felt the pulse fade as I pumped the cuff, remembering the number at which it faded, to use as an estimate. I regret not allowing 15-30 seconds before continuing the procedure as recommended by Dougherty & Lister (2015). I repeated my actions but now with a stethoscope at the brachial artery crease. I held the diaphragm of the stethoscope down lightly but firmly by the bell with my thumb, while grasping the patients arm lightly. I was conscious of my grasp, as to not skew the results with excess pressure on the arm (Dougherty & Lister 2015). I pumped the cuff 20-30mmHg past the estimated BP value. I slowly opened the valve listening attentively to hear the Korotkoff sounds. I heard the first sound and noted it as the systolic BP and noted the last sound as the diastolic BP. I removed the cuff from the patient's arm and informed them of their result before writing it on the Early Warning Score (EWS) Chart.  <b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[11]" data-img="N11.png" data-reflexsect="wh">Lastly I checked if the patient was comfortable</b>, sanitized my hands before cleaning the equipment and after cleaning it.

<div class="overflow-auto" style="width:1200px;height:200px;line-height:2em;padding:5px;overflow:scroll;float:left;font-size:12px;margin-top:10px;margin-left:30px;">

<h2>What was significant? </h2>
I felt by introducing myself and showing genuine concern about the patient's wellbeing, I reduced the 'white coat effect' (Rafey 2009). 'The white coat effect' is a temporary rise in blood pressure experienced by an individual, when a doctor or nurse is taking their BP. I was constantly narrating myself and <b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[2,3,4,5,8]" data-img="N23458.png" data-reflexsect="sig">ensuring the patient was comfortable</b> and that neither the sleeve nor the cuff was too tight on their arm (Dougherty & Lister 2015). I admit I did get slightly bewildered when I discovered the valve on the sphygmomanometer was missing, thus I had to use a replacement sphygmomanometer with a cuff intended for obese people. In hindsight,<b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[2,3,4,9]" data-img="N2349.png" data-reflexsect="sig"> I should not have become so flustered as I then forgot to change the obesity cuff to a standard cuff perhaps leading to the high diastolic value I recorded</b>. It's been proven that an ill fitting cuff can give inaccurate results (Dougherty & Lister 2015). I just assumed that all the equipment was present and working, which is an assumption I'll never make again. In practice it is critical to check and recheck things in order to save resources (Mirzaei et al. 2012).

I was pleased that I remembered the five conditions that hinder taking one's blood pressure, which are, if they have or had; brachial artery surgery, trauma/surgery to the arm/axilla, an arteriovenous fistula in sitiu, visible lymphoedema or an intravenous infusion in progress (Dougherty & Lister 2015). I performed the skill to the best of my ability but forgot to ask if the patient needed to use the bathroom before commencing and their arm of preference to have their BP taken from. It's easy to forget to communicate when focused on the action. I regret not giving the patient input into these choices and will therefore make it my priority to get patients' input during such procedures in the future. In a real clinical setting I would do the BP on both arms to get more accuracy, especially on the elderly, pregnant women and people who are arrhythmic or obese (Beevers 2001). I also wrote the BP into the heart rate section of the EWS Chart which I apologized for in the video.

<h2>Now what ? </h2>

Upon reviewing my performance, I'm quite pleased with my communication during the performance but feel I could have worked at a faster pace. I'm conscious that sometimes my perfectionist tendencies can affect my time management, which is an area I'll have to review in more detail. Perhaps upon returning to the clinical area, I will begin to time myself and set personal goals for completing tasks (Mirzaei et al. 2012). Henceforth, <b class="contextText" style="color:orange;font-size:18" data-clicked ="false" data-usr="N1" data-slots ="[2,3,4,9,11]" data-img="N234911.png" data-reflexsect="end">I plan to check all equipment before beginning procedures</b>, give adequate patient response time and most importantly fasten my pace. 'The Reflective Cycle' by Rolfe et al. (2010) really helped me to identify areas of improvement in my clinical practice. Reflection is about evaluating your own mistakes and letting others examine them too as part of the learning process (Oliveira 2015).
